It allows users to search for information on the Internet by entering keywords or phrases. Google Search uses algorithms to analyze and rank websites based on their relevance to the search query. It is the most popular search engine worldwide.

                    <p class="card-text">Every year, we see trillions of searches. Google's Search features ensure that you get the right information at the right time in the format that's most useful to your query. Sometimes it's a web page, and sometimes it's real-world information like a map or inventory at a local shop.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The Knowledge Graph is our database of more than five billion real-world people, places and things with over 500 billion facts. You can get quick information to questions like 'What is the Eiffel Tower?', 'How tall is it?' or 'When was it first opened?', and then click to explore across the web.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">It was always pretty obvious that when people searched on Google for an address – for example 'Bushwood Road' – that they didn’t want a link to websites mentioning this street. They most likely wanted to know where it was and how to get there. So, Search contains maps when appropriate that can help you get to where you want to go, or more easily locate local businesses and information.</p>
